	 <br>
	 On the orders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion" target="_blank">David Ben-Gurion</a>, the IDF was formed on 26 May 1948 and began to operate as a conscript military, drawing its initial recruits from the already-exisitng paramilitaries of the Yishuv- namely Haganah, the Irgun, and Lehi. It was formed shortly after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence" target="_blank">Israeli Declaration of Independance</a>, and has participated in every armed conflict involving Israel.
